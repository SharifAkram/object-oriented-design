=begin

Examine the preceding code and make a list of the situations in which Gear
would be forced to change because of a change to Wheel. This code seems
innocent, but itâ€™s sneakily complex. Gear has at least four dependencies
on Wheel, enumerated as follows. Most of the dependencies are unnecessary;
they are a side effect of the coding style. Gear does not need them to do
its job. Their very existence weakens Gear and makes it harder to change.
