# The next alternative isolates creation of a new Wheel in its own
# explicitly defined wheel method. This new method lazily creates a
# new instance of Wheel, using Rubyâ€™s ||= operator. In this case,
# creation of a new instance of Wheel is deferred until gear_inches
# invokes the new wheel method.
